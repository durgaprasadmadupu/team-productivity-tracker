# 🧠 Team Productivity Tracker

A simple web app to help teams log tasks, track weekly progress, and monitor overall productivity in a clear, organized way.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Teams often struggle to track their weekly work progress and completed tasks in a centralized place. This project aims to solve that by building a lightweight, user-friendly tool that allows task logging, time tracking, and visual summaries — especially useful for small to mid-sized teams like those at Glad Power.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Allow users to log tasks with status
- Enable week-wise tracking of task progress
- Authenticate users so they can manage their own tasks
- Show dashboards and visual summaries (charts)
- Deploy both frontend and backend so it can be easily accessed and tested
